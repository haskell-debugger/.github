## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

> [!NOTE] 
> This is a group dedicated to researching and implementing deep code introspection and step-by-step debugging of GHC Haskell 
> code using modern tooling (like `VSCode` and the `external-stg-interpreter`).

### Interests
  - Realtime haskell heap view visualization
  - Space leak detection
  - Step-by-step debugging for GHC's STG IR.
  - The external STG interpreter / debugger tooling
  - Data visualization + GUI design
  - Profiling

### Goals
  - To bring about a more modern development experience for GHC Haskell users.
  - Solving the opacity problem for GHC users
